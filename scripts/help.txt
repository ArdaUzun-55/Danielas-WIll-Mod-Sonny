!THE CODES ARE NEWER THAN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE MOD!
  
How to find Sonny 2017 Buffs:
1. Every _root.hackMove2[], from which the array is 52 -> 124 
2. Every entry after 124 is for chapter 3 of my mod
How to find Sonny 2017 abilities mechanics:
1. Every entry before _root.hackMove[79] and after 25

DO NOTE:
The implementations of some mechanics are coded differently than how it actually should be.
One example is Flame Jet. Since its mechanic is only available for one enemy,
I was a bit lazy to make it 100% like in SOnny 2017. But I actually have something which can be used for Flame Jet now, 
alled abilityhistory. It can store a value of the latest ability used. The good thing is that it can store anything.
