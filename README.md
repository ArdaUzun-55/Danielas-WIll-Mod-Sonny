Starting at Chapter 1 I will release all versions here including "pre-releases"

# Danielas WIll (Sonny 2 Mod)
Mod Information

Mod name: Danielas WIll

Mod release date: 15.02.2022

*About this Mod*

You are followed by Danielas apprentices into new alcatraz, oberursel, the ivory train, the tunnel and hew because you fought Danielas WIll and stole her scroll. After defeating the mayor you sensed something from a far away country named Kshatriyana. You go in the country and fight through Danielas and her archenemies troops! Find the WIll and enjoy the new items, abilites and enemies. You also find another friend who was taught into using the earth element as it's fighting skill. Then you enter Utopia, where you encounter very weird things. Currently only the first Chapter is there.

This mod is huge so I recommend taking your time to play it.

-Version Changes

1.01: new class ; new zone which is currently nothing though its work in progress ; Changed something about Fundas allies ; I also added another shop to Kshatriyana ; Remember: You dont need to edit your save file in order to play the other classes open the txt.file in order to find out;

1.02: bug fix for one of the classes

1.03: buffed the new class and nerfed the mokoshotar fight

1.04: change at the first fight with the Berserker of Danielas WIll in hew

1.1: New Zone is done and playable. Currently only Chapter 1. Kshatriyanas level curve is between 22 and 30. Items got nerved and so on. New sounds from Sonny 2017. I posted some videos and images in the sonny reddit. The green extra side story is only doable once per day and It shares its progress with the main story. Since its chapter 1 I decided to make "Silver strand" from sonny 2017 in Sonny 2. Just out of fun. Every enemy in the side story use the sounds from sonny 2017 proof: https://i.imgur.com/2lwWTWT.png. New Element. The New zone will have those text pop ups like the one at the beginning of the game. They will help you understand the story. Kshatriyana shortened. Exp taken is reduced. I recommend starting a new save. Every Zone is accessible in every difficulty. No achievements are needed. I count this as a "Beta" and not as a "Complete" Version, because it needs to be tested 100%. New Battle animations.

1.101: Dark infusion had 99 power scaling fixed it

-Upcoming update

1.2: Chapter 2 is done. Max level increased to 34. new ally. new allies have a face sprite in the inventory screen now. new sounds from sonny 2017. The green extra side story is doable 5 times per day then you wait one day. This time the side story tells you about the past of utopia. New sprite armor (Blackflame armor) pictures incoming. 6 types of ZPCIs. New battlebackgrounds (forest, day snow, zpci stroghold). +100 new abilities and buffs. added another difficulty. Achievement change and more! This chapter brings a lot of new things! The Ally works right if you start a new save else its not working. Redfield reworked. Extra training fight button for Chapter 2

-Extras

There is another .zip file which needs a password in order to be opened. In the zip file there is a .txt file which includes secrets for example how to play psycho. Also there are some other things in there. Another thing I would like to mention is that the password can be found ingame. It is easy to find.
