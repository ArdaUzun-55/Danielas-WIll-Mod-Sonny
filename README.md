Starting at Chapter 1 I will release all versions here including "pre-releases"

# Danielas WIll (Sonny 2 Mod)
Mod Information

Mod name: Danielas WIll!    

Mod release date: 15.02.2022

# About this Mod

You are followed by Danielas apprentices into new alcatraz, oberursel, the ivory train, the tunnel and hew because you fought Danielas WIll and stole her scroll. After defeating the mayor you sensed something from a far away country named Kshatriyana. You go in the country and fight through Danielas and her archenemies troops! Find the WIll and enjoy the new items, abilites and enemies. You also find another friend who was taught into using the earth element as it's fighting skill. Then you enter Utopia, where you encounter very weird things. Currently only the first two Chapters are there.

This mod is huge so I recommend taking your time to play it.

# Version Changes

1.01: new class ; new zone which is currently nothing though its work in progress ; Changed something about Fundas allies ; I also added another shop to Kshatriyana ; Remember: You dont need to edit your save file in order to play the other classes open the txt.file in order to find out;

1.02: bug fix for one of the classes

1.03: buffed the new class and nerfed the mokoshotar fight

1.04: change at the first fight with the Berserker of Danielas WIll in hew

1.1: New Zone is done and playable. Currently only Chapter 1. Kshatriyanas level curve is between 22 and 30. Items got nerved and so on. New sounds from Sonny 2017. I posted some videos and images in the sonny reddit. The green extra side story is only doable once per day and It shares its progress with the main story. Since its chapter 1 I decided to make "Silver strand" from sonny 2017 in Sonny 2. Just out of fun. Every enemy in the side story use the sounds from sonny 2017 proof: https://i.imgur.com/2lwWTWT.png. New Element. The New zone will have those text pop ups like the one at the beginning of the game. They will help you understand the story. Kshatriyana shortened. Exp taken is reduced. I recommend starting a new save. Every Zone is accessible in every difficulty. No achievements are needed. I count this as a "Beta" and not as a "Complete" Version, because it needs to be tested 100%. New Battle animations.

1.101: Dark infusion had 99 power scaling fixed it

1.2: Chapter 2 is done. Max level increased to 34. new ally. new allies have a face sprite in the inventory screen now. new sounds from sonny 2017. The green extra side story is doable 5 times per day then you wait one day. This time the side story tells you about the past of utopia. New sprite armor (Blackflame armor) pictures incoming. 6 types of ZPCIs. New battlebackgrounds (forest, day snow, zpci stroghold). +100 new abilities and buffs. added another difficulty. Achievement change and more! This chapter brings a lot of new things! The Ally works right if you start a new save else its not working. Redfield reworked. Extra training fight button for Chapter 2

1.21: 
- New class "ZPCI Teachings"
- Baron & Cult Leader boss fight got a Boss theme
- Item Icon from ZPCI Elite armor fixed
- ZPCI Sniper & Medic got 2 new abilities
- Bug fix
- Twin Guardians shield got nerved 10000 to 5000 700 healing to 300 (10.11.2022)

 1.3 : Big Update featuring:

New Side Stories to all zones;

->Sonny 2017 Zones

->new Mechanics

->almost every mechanic from Sonny 2017 i now available in Sonny 2

, for example Auras like Chromascreen, Black Mirror, Dark Absorb, ETC.

-> Aoe doesnt work with all new mechanics, because I am lazy, but aoe mechanics by enemies always work. So its just only for Sonny, sayable i guess.

->Kshatriyana shortened and rewritten, new script and new structure, no repition, 1 returning enemy from Sonny 1 Danieals WIll Mod Zone 4.

->Side Storys now dont share the progress with the main story anymore so you cant really farm one fight, in return the daily limit got removed. In Side stories you only gain items not EXP.

-> Sprites from Sonny 2017 added.

-> Fundas class got a bit of a change.

-> Danielas class got a bit of a change

-> Every Zone now got a change, not every enemy but there are more unique things now, including different stages.

-> You need to start a new save file

# Extras

There is another .zip file which needs a password in order to be opened.I would like to mention is that the password can be found ingame. It is easy to find.

# CODE PERMISSION (NEW MECHANICS)

Here is what I allow one to use without asking permission if you would like to take the code for the new mechanics for your own mod:

-Every Sonny 2017 Mechanic which was added
-Every Sonny 2017 Stuff like Sprites

Here is what I dont allow one to use without asking permission (dm me and maybe I say yes or no) if you would like to take the code for the new mechanics for your own mod:

-New mechanics including: Bleed and Frostbite
-Mechanics which did not exist in Sonny 2017, Sonny 1 and Sonny 2 e.g. Fundas Misery (many more which are in the github code)
-The Blackflame Element
-And maybe more

Also credit me if you take my code :)

The up to date code can be found in github! Note: The current code contains many new mechanics and it is still in test phase and dont copy everything because the DOTTICKERARRAY is different than the original one.

I will try to update it every 2nd day starting from today 08.05.2024
