Story
You are followed by Danielas apprentices into new alcatraz, oberursel, the ivory train, the tunnel and hew because you fought Danielas WIll and stole the scroll. After defeating the mayor you wanted to enter Utopia, but the borders were closed to Kshatriyana. So you did not have any other choice than to fight Daniela (The current Leader of the country and the apprentices) and end the civil War in Kshatriyana.

<details> 
  <summary>Captain Hunt Guide</summary>
 This boss is a bit different than the normal version. First of all nobody of them can get their focus reduced, but they can be stunned. Captain Hunt doesnt do anything in the first 3 turns. Focus on killing ZPCI Sniper and stun him when he used his buffs on himself. Then after their mini phase is done they need to charge their focus again. At this point Captain Hunt will begin attacking. Basically Captain Hunt first blasts one of your teammates. That target which got hit should not attack the next turns (A.i. will automatically stop using offensive abilities after getting Fire Vulnerablity Up), BECAUSE CAPTAIN HUNTS NEXT TARGETS WILL BE BASED ON WHO EVER DEALT THE MOST DAMAGE THAT TURN (Healing or anything else counts as 0 Damage), after Captain Hunts miniphase is over he needs to recharge and ZPCI Sniper/Medic will begin with their stuff again. At this point the ZPCI Sniper should be focused on getting killed. After that Captain Hunt will do the same stuff again. Then he needs to recharge again. Here you need to focus on bringing Captain Hunt down to 50% After he recharged his next ability is going to deal damage based on how many remaining allies Captain Hunt has. Then he will cast another AOE ability but this time it will kill you if Captain Hunt has more than 50% of its HP remaining (even if you survive this somehow you, you will lose), After that he will be stunned and easy to kill.

  <summary>Mayor & Guardian Cannon Guide</summary>
You need to kill the Guardian Cannon before turn 7 or he will wipe your entire team (you will lose even if you survive). The Mayor will enrage. For this phase keep an eye out and mitigate the damage properly. After he unenrages you basically can calm down. After some turns he will shield himself. Save your high damage for this phase because he will charge Power as long as he has this shield. Also react swifltly as the Mayor's Power charges as long as your turn time is running! After this mini phase you just need to kill the Mayor. After some time the mayor will kill you instantly (even if you survive this somehow you, you will lose)

  <summary>Ceyda The Human Spider Guide</summary>
Not much to say the entire fight is changed. Just make sure to have enough healing if you need help for this fight write me.

<details> 
  <summary>Daniela & 2x Danielas Creation Guide</summary>
Every twelth round Danielas creation will be resurrected (if they were stunned (because of death)). When she hits 50% she will switch to her 2nd phase. Here you need to kill Danielas Creations. Because she will store Power during this phase. (like the Mayor boss fight). Make sure to kill them ASAP. Her ultimate deals damage based on how many units are alive and how much power she stored. After that she returns to using her usual abilities. If she has 100 Power then you lose.
