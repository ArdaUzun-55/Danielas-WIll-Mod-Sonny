Abilities:
Note: Not all things are generalized, meaning some things are special for certain abilities, though I started to generalize later (at the start of doing these things I did not generalize much).
also I for whatever reason skipped some numbers e.g. 36 dont mind it, you can use them for whatever you want.

[30] = How much percent chance it has to afflict [29]
[33-5] = To dispell buffs from yourself
