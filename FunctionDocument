Abilities:
Note: Not all things are generalized, meaning some things are special for certain abilities, though I started to generalize later (at the start of doing these things I did not generalize much).
also I for whatever reason skipped some numbers e.g. 36 dont mind it, you can use them for whatever you want.
[29] = Applies a second Buff/Debuff
[30] = How much percent chance it has to afflict [29]
[33-5] = To dispell buffs from yourself
[40] = Applies a third Buff/Debuff
[45] = How many times it hits the enemy
[53] = used for acide bomb, deals damage to yourself after usage of ability
[57] = Drill Strike, if the targets HP is lower than [57]% then the damage increases by 50%
[58] = ignore defense (only if defense is implemented)
[59] = Deals damage based on target's current HP. 
[60] = if casters HP is less or equal to [60]% then it is AOE
[63] = used for Flame Jet, ice drill
[65] = If target's HP is below [65]%, gain 2x multi-strike. 
[67] = used in combination with [13] + [29] to make the buff[29] apply to self
[68] = if less than [68] ability deals 140%
[69] = if target has physical debuff deals 80% more damage.
[70] = crit damage increase (example: Arcflash)
[71] = damages caster for [71]% instinct
[72] = used together with [70]
[73] = recover [73]% of the dmg dealt
[74] = 50% chance to apply [29] if crit
[75] = Used for abilities with cooldownonStarts (negative cooldowns), this [75] will be the abilitys cooldown
[76] =  if the target was not hit at the previous turn, ability will be strengthened by [76]%
[77] = Defense scaling 
[78] = Used to determine whether an ability is a basic ability
[79] = Bleed Buildup
[80] = Frost Buildup
[81] = secondary element piercing
[82] = Buff only applies when crit [13]
[83] = if ability bleeds then apply [83]
[84] = heals [84]% of targets HP (add)
[85] = used for several things, for example Dark Snake
[86] = if ability kills then apply [86]
[87] = if ability bleeds then apply [83] [to target]
[89] = Crit damage is increased by 50%
[90] = used by Rani the queens Electrocution ability, if target has [99] element then apply [90]
[91] = Last hit deals [91] more damage than the previous hits
[92] = For combo abilities
[93] = used to determine whether the targets ability was "Heal" for example, in the case of APostles Blackflame ability this is used with [94] to increase the damage by [94]% (if target has "Heal", "Focus3", but [93] can be anything even "Full Damage")
[94] = used to increase damage against targets which used [93] type abilities
[95] = used to make the ability usable at [95]% of HP. E.g. 0.5 would be that the ability is usable while the caster has 50% of its HP left or below.
[97] = Applies [97] if target has a buff with [144] not equal to 0
[98] = used to mimic
[99] = see [90]
